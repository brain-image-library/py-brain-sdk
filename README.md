# py-brain-sdk

py-brain-sdk is a Python library that simplifies interaction with the Brain Image Library (BIL), a national public resource for neuroscience research. BIL provides access to petabyte-scale brain microscopy datasets, including whole and partial brain images, neuron morphologies, connectivity data, and spatial transcriptomics. This SDK enables researchers, data scientists, and developers to programmatically query, download, and analyze BIL datasets, leveraging its APIs and integrated analysis ecosystem.

With py-brain-sdk, you can

* Search and retrieve brain imaging datasets and metadata.
* Download specific image files or subsets of large datasets.
* Interface with BIL’s visualization and computational tools.

This SDK is designed to streamline workflows for neuroscience research, making it easier to integrate BIL’s vast resources into your 
Python projects.
